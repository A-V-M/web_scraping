# web_scraping
playing around with scraping articles from google.. quite primitive but it works

in its current version it will search for relevant articles given a specific country name and then
save them in a pandas DataFrame. any articles with a word count lower than 200 are automatically excluded.

using Beautiful Soup 4.6.0 and newspaper 0.1.0.7
